                    <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Currently, you can't. We would really like to do this, as it's on the top of our wish list, but we do not have the resources to host private rooms. We are a small website that doesn't make any money, so just paying for the host right now is already difficult enough.</p></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><p>You can add a song if you are logged in, by clicking on the Add Song button under the video in the station you want to add your song in. That will open up a modal where you can search search for a song by putting a search query there or by putting a link in there and clicking the Search Song button. You can then edit some more information, like the artist and title. It's helpful for us if you fill those in so we don't have to research every song, but you are not required to. You can also import playlists from YouTube.</p></div>
