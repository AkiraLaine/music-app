                        There are essentially 3 main ways in which you can help us:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                If you are a JavaScript developer, then we can use your help! Our project is open source and all the
                                source code can be found on GitHub. We would love for you to create new features, add exciting
                                content or just improve what already is on Musare. Also, if you see a bug or glitch on Musare, then
                                create a new
                                "issue" on GitHub and we will fix it as soon as possible. You can also have a try at fixing a
                                bug that you may find!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you are not a developer but want some way of supporting us - you can donate to Musare. Any
                                amount of donation is highly appreciated, and will help us maintain server costs.
